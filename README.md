# Vector2D-Vector3D
This program establishes two classes, Vecteur2D and Vecteur3D, which signify 2D and 3D vectors, respectively. The Vecteur3D class is a subclass of the Vecteur2D class, inheriting its properties. Both classes encapsulate vector operations and offer methods for accessing, modifying, and comparing vectors.
